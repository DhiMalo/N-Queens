#N-Queens

<strong> The N-Queens problem dates back to 1850. Many famous mathematicians, including Carl Friedrich Gauss, have worked on solutions. This repository documents my process of building complex algorithm for it using JavaScript. </strong>
>THE PUZZLE: How many ways can you place n queens on an n√ón chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other? Each solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

This is a project I completed as a student at [Telegraph Academy](http://telegraphacademy.com). This project was worked on with a pair.
